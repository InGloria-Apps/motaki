This project is a port from the Master Thesis of Tiago Peralta to the mobile ecosystem.
The existing Android app is insuficient for the existing users and so I decided to write a small wrapper to allow it to be used in iOS and Android.

There's no relation at all between me and the author of the Master Thesis and all credits should go to Tiago Peralta.
